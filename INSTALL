Unfortunatelly no Makefile is available to install Fvwm-Nightshade easily.
Also only the login via login manager is supported because .xinitrc not finished.

so, if you're willing to test Fvwm-Nightshade follow the steps below:

1. Get latest Fvwm from CVS:
    - Open http://www.fvwm.org/documentation/dev_cvs.php
    - Do the Initial Setup
    - Checking Out Source Code:
       cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.fvwm.org:/home/cvs/fvwm co -r branch-2_6 fvwm
    - Building the Tree:
       utils/configure_dev.sh
2. Install all needed dev libs:
     deb:
       - mostly the libs in braces in the "no" lines at the end of the
	 configure call
       - also package libXt-dev if X11/Intrinsic.h not found while make
     rpm:
       - for full list see http://www.fvwm.org/documentation/dev_creating_rpms.php
3. Compile Fvwm:
     deb:
       - make deb-inplace
     rpm:
       unfortunatelly the rpm way doesn't work at the moment. The following fix this
       problem:
       - rename bin/fvwm-menu-desktop-config.fpl into bin/fvwm-menu-desktop-config.fpl.in
       - added in configure.ac after line 1766:
	 bin/fvwm-menu-desktop-config.fpl
       - do make rpm-dist
4. Install Fvwm
5. Install all required packages for Fvwm-Nightshade:
    python-xdg, xterm, conky, xscreensaver, eterm, imagemagick, stalonetray, wm-icons
6. Install Fvwm-Nighshade:
    - download it from https://github.com/Fvwm-Nightshade/Fvwm-Nightshade/tree/develop
    - unpack it and enter expanded folder
    - change to root
	cp bin/* /usr/local/bin/
	cp system/fvwm-nightshade.desktop /usr/share/xsessions/
	cp -r fvwm-nightshade /usr/local/share/
	mkdir /usr/local/share/doc
	mkdir /usr/local/share/doc/fvwm-nightshade
	cp doc/* /usr/local/share/doc/fvwm-nightshade/
	cp AUTHORS ChangeLog COPYING README INSTALL /usr/local/share/doc/fvwm-nightshade/

7. login into Fvwm-Nightshade, change the base settings and enjoy.
