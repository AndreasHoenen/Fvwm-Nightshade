===========

Fvwm
----

1. Get latest Fvwm 
    a. from distribution if available
    b. from Fvwm homepage
	- open http://www.fvwm.org/download/ and download latest release
	- unpack it
    c. from Fvwm CVS:
	- Open http://www.fvwm.org/documentation/dev_cvs.php
	- Do the Initial Setup

	   cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.fvwm.org:/home/cvs/fvwm co -r branch-2_6 fvwm

2. Prepare source code
    rpm:
	- follow instructions under http://www.fvwm.org/documentation/dev_creating_rpms.php
	- about rpm-dist:
	    unfortunatelly it doesn't work at the moment. You've to fix the following:
	    - rename bin/fvwm-menu-desktop-config.fpl into bin/fvwm-menu-desktop-config.fpl.in
	    - add in configure.ac after line 1766:
	      bin/fvwm-menu-desktop-config.fpl

    - Building the Tree:
       utils/configure_dev.sh

3. Install all needed dev libs:
    deb:
	- mostly the libs in braces in the "no" lines at the end of the
	  configure call
	- also package libXt-dev if X11/Intrinsic.h not found while make
    rpm:
	- for full list see http://www.fvwm.org/documentation/dev_creating_rpms.php

3. Compile Fvwm:
    - run ./configure --prefix=/usr
    deb:
	- make deb-inplace
